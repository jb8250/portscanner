<h1>Port Scanner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This Python script is a basic network port scanner. It checks if any of the 65,535 ports on a specified IP address (in this case, "47.42.10.27") are open and accessible. An open port indicates that there might be a service running and listening on that port.   

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

It defines a function (check_port) that attempts to connect to a specific port on a given host (IP address) using a short timeout. If the connection is successful, it considers the port as "open."

It sets the target host IP address to "47.42.10.27."

It defines the range of ports to scan, from port 1 to port 65,535. This covers all possible ports.

It starts scanning each port within the defined range using the check_port function and updates a progress bar as it goes through the ports.

If an open port is found, it adds that port number to a list called open_ports.

After scanning all the ports, it displays the list of open ports, if any were found.

In essence, this script helps you identify which ports on the specified IP address are open and potentially running services that could be accessed over the network. It's a basic form of network reconnaissance and can be used for various purposes, including security assessments and network troubleshooting. However, always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any target IP address.
